# Structural patterns
Structural patterns responding for creating correct system architecture,
where existing classes and objects could easily interact with each other.

There are two types of **structural** patterns:
- Class-level patterns

  Describes interaction between classes and their subclasses.
  
- Object-level patterns
  
  Describes interaction between objects.
